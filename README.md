Agenda :
•	Time Series 
•	Importance of Time Series 
•	Smoothing Methods
•	Project on Time Series with Airlines dataset
•	ARIMA Model 
Time Series :
1.	It is an sequence of values of a variable at equal spaced time internal .
2.	It is a series of datapoints ordered in time .
3.	Time series analysis is a statistical technique that deals with time series data ,or trend aalysis.Time series data means that data is in a series of particular periods or intervals.
4.	We refer today as T ,yesterday as T-1 day before yesterday as T-2 and henceforth .And T+1 for tomorrow and so on .
5.	The data is considered in 3 types:
1.	Time series data : A set of observation on the values that a variable take different times .
2.	Cross-Sectional data: Data of one or more variables, collected at the same point in tie
3.	Pooled data: A combination of time series data and cross-sectional data .
6.	We dont take in consideration seasonal data or stats in time series .
7.	We drop trends also in time series because it get vulnerabilities .
8.	After dropping these factors we can do time series forecasting .
9.	We can have different types of time interval .
10.	Here have only 2 variable time and value.
Importance of Time Series :
1.	Time series is very important to solve a lot of problems in the business.
2.	Based on time we create a lot of data .
3.	We can use this to predict future operations.
Application :
1.	Economic Forecasting
2.	Sales Forecasting
3.	Budget analysis
4.	Stock market analysis
5.	Inventory studies etc




Time series components:
1.	It can be described in terms of 4 basic classes of components:
1.	Trend : It is a long term direction of a time series .It exist in long term increase or decrease in the data. It does not have to be linear, sometimes we will refer to a trend “changing direction”, when it might go from an increasing trend to a decreasing trend.
2.	Seasonal : It is a regular pattern of variability within certain time periods such as year.
3.	Cyclical: Any regular pattern of sequences of values above and below the trend.
4.	Irregular: Cannot be defined it can change without a pattern.

Stationarity : 
### Rule for TimeSeries Data
- Data should be stationary..
- By nature no data has stationary format, We have to convert the data into stationary data then we can apply TimeSeries techniques.
 







Smoothing Methods:
1.	It removes the random variations and shows trend and cyclic components.
2.	When a time series contains a large amount of noise, it can be difficult to visualize any underlying trend.
3.	There are 2 methods.
ARIMA Model:
1.	Auto Regressive (AR) Integrated(I) Moving Average (MA)
ACF &PACF :
1.	Auto Correlation Factor and Partial Auto Correlation Factor
